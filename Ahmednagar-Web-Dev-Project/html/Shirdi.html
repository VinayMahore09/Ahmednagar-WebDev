				<h2>history</h2>
				<p>
Shirdi is famously known as the home of the late 19th century saint Shri Sai Baba. The Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust located in Shirdi is one of the richest temple organisations.
Sai Baba of Shirdi (died 15 October 1918), also known as Shirdi Sai Baba, was an Indian spiritual master who is regarded by his devotees to be a manifestation of Sri Dattaguru and identified as a saint and a fakir.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					During the 19th and the 20th century, the country witnessed Shirdi Sai Movement, which renewed the faith, customs and rituals among the Hindus. During the 19th century, Baba's devotees mainly consisted of a large population of Hindu's and Muslim. However, towards the beginning of the 20th century, even Christians and Zoroastrians began to adopt the principles of Sai Baba. Many believe that the main aim behind this religious renaissance was to bring world peace and harmony. The main people responsible for the movement were his devotees like B. V. Narasimhaswamiji, Guruji C. B. Satpathy and Swami Sai Sharananand, who not only followed Baba's preaching's but also helped in spreading his beliefs. Besides Baba's devotees, the members of the Shirdi Mandir have taken all pains to set up various temples of Baba in the country and across the globe.
