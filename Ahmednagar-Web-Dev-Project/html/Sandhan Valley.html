			<h2>Best Time For Sandhan Valley Trek</h2>
			<br />

			<p>
			There is no limitation to when you plan on this trek. You can do this at any time of the year. It is, however, preferable that you do not do it in the summers. As the temperatures soar, you will not be able to enjoy the trek very well. Most of your energy will be swapped by enduring the heat.
			</p>

			<br />
			<h2>Best Places To Visit On The Trek</h2>

			<p> <strong>•AMK Forts</strong>

			</p> <br>
			<p>Make sure that you are trekking uphill to the ancient forts of Alang, Madan, and Kulang. But if you are too tired after the main trek then make sure you are getting some rest before you head out for the second trek to these forts the next day.</p>

			<br>
			 <strong> <p>•Ratangad Fort</p></strong>
			<br>
			<p>This is another fort that you cannot miss. Going to this fort is a steep ascent but it is not much of a demanding experience so you can do it on the same day as the AMK forts.</p>
			<br />
		 <strong> <p>•Nanhe Ghat Waterfalls</p></strong>	 <br>
			<p>
				This waterfall is just a few kilometers away from base camp so make sure that you go to Ratanawadi to visit this. It’ll be a refreshing experience to have a picnic near this beautifully cascading waterfall and/or take a dip in the pool that collects at the base of it.
			</p>

			<br />
			<!-- <h3>Ambarkhana</h3>
			<p>
				The Amberkhana, situated in the center of the fort, were three
				granaries built in the Bijapuri style of architecture. They enabled
				Shivaji to withstand a 5-month siege by Siddhi Johar. It consists of
				three buildings called the Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati Kothis.
